# Simple_Cp_calculation
A Jupyter notebook with a step-by-step calculation of the Cp. It also contains a simple visualization of the probability density. 
The mean, the standard deviation, and the specification limits can be changed as desired. The Cp index, the probability for a 
value outside the specification limits and PPM are calculated. Just open the file in Visual Studio Code and start experimenting.
